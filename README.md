<h1>Water Motor Status Prediction using Machine Learning</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
This project involves building a Machine Learning model that predicts whether a water motor should be turned ON or OFF based on the soil moisture levels of crops. The goal is to automate irrigation management by determining the optimal motor state to maintain adequate soil moisture, ensuring efficient water usage.

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
Managing water resources efficiently is crucial in agriculture. Over-irrigation can lead to water wastage and soil degradation, while under-irrigation can affect crop yield. This project addresses these challenges by predicting the status of a water motor—whether it should be ON or OFF—based on real-time soil moisture readings.

<h3>Approach</h3>
We developed a Machine Learning model that takes soil moisture levels as input and predicts the motor status. A threshold soil moisture level is set as a baseline. If the moisture level falls below this threshold, the model predicts the motor should be ON; otherwise, it should be OFF. The model is trained on historical data to improve prediction accuracy.

<h3>Results</h3>
The model provides reliable predictions that help automate irrigation, optimize water usage, and support sustainable agriculture practices.
